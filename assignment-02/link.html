                HTML is basic language used to create web pages. it works with tags and elements to organize content
                like text, images, links, and headings. Every website starts with HTML because it gives the page its
                structure. Browsers reads HTML to understand what to display and where to place it. Without HTML, a web
                pages would just be plain text with no format. It is simple to learn and is the first step for anyone
                starting <i>Web-Development.</i>
